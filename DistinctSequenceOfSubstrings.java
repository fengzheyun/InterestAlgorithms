/*
Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct substrings of T in S.

T is formed by a set of substrings, and each substring is constituted by repeating a single letter for 2 or 4 times. 
If a letter 'a' is repeated for twice, the substring is written as "a+"; if it is repeated for four times, its 
consequent substring is "a-"
(ie, "a+c+e-" is a subsequence of substrings of "aabbaacceeee" while "a+e-c+" and "a-c+e-" are not).

Here is an example:
S = "waeginsapnaabangpisebbasepgnccccapisdnfngaabndlrjngeuiogbbegbuoecccc", T = "a+b+c-"

Return 3.
